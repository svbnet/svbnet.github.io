Hi there! Greetings, good day, and thank you for visiting what is possibly the best website in the world.

My name is Joe, and I'm a software developer, tinkerer, hacker, and maker. I'm interested in taking odd and interesting things apart, taking photos and videos of them, and seeing if I can make them do something else. Hopefully, this website will allow me to post what I come across, as well as any other thoughts or observations on my mind.

### Projects

I'm also ~~struggling at~~ learning how to model things in CAD, to be 3D printed. So far these have been very odd things that I've wanted to print just to fix a very particular problem in my life - I'm learning that this is a common reason to get into making your own 3D printable objects. Regardless, I'll be sharing a bunch of my models if I think they could be useful to someone else.

Lastly, while software development is my day job, it's also inevitably my night job as well. I don't have many public repositories that demonstrate my raw power and talent, but if I write something that I think could help others, I'll try and put it here.

### Your website is cool! How did you make it?

This website was created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I know both Ruby and HTML/Sass, so it only makes sense to go with a static site generator that uses both minimally. Above all else, I want someone to be able to archive or rip this website easily - I don't care about comments or any other fancy features - I just want to write words in a format that will maybe be around in 500 years' time. Humble, I know.

In terms of the layout, I think I did it wrong. Well, not 'wrong', but I'm not sure how to create a new theme so I kind of just hacked on the default 'minima' theme. This is certainly not 'minima' (more like 'retro-a'), but it works for me. I wanted to make a homage to the early web - I think websites should be a personal reflection of the author, rather than a carefully manicured but generic template. In keeping with the that spirit, most of the GIFs and image assets were ripped using [GIFCities](https://gifcities.org/).

### Who drew the picture on your header?

My friend Krupa drew the picture. It's based on [this photo](https://iceblog.org/2020/11/27/the-arctic-the-climate-some-gloom-but-no-doom-and-a-promise-of-progress/) by Esther Horvath.

### How can I get in touch with you?
